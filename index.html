            <b>Ate Raki: </b>I was lost— it has been 6 years or so since I have
            been looking for answers. <br /><br />
            I was 13 and confused. Honestly, naaya lang ako before. Akala ko pa
            nga, hindi ko maeenjoy since I’m not a church person but
            surprisingly, I did. I felt closer to God than I ever was. Slowly, I
            embraced religion and to be honest, I was already questioning it
            before. Totoo pala; totoo na hindi mo makikita si Lord. Pero you
            know what I realized? Totoong ramdam mo Siya. Totoong makikita mo
            Siya in different forms and faces. In my case? I saw Him through The
            Feast. I believed— I do still believe. From then on, O was
            encouraged by Kuya Ge to serve and I decided to take his offer.
            Hindi madali— wala namang madali. Pero I realized na kahit mahirap,
            kahit maraming nawawala, bumabalik, at nadadagdag, andiyan pa rin si
            Lord pa sa’tin. Sabi nga nila, the more na nalalapit ka kay Lord,
            the more challenges you will face and that’s true. Noong pandemic,
            nawala ‘yung nakasanayan na’ting small and big hangouts. Hindi namin
            alam kung paano magpapatuloy at higut sa lahat, hindi namin alam
            kung ipag papatuloy pa ba. First few months, nakapag adapt sa online
            set up. Sa una, wala gaano nanonood, wala gaanong engagements,
            hanggang sa dumami at nawala ulit— nakakadrain. We decided to take a
            break at nagpa guide kay Lord sa magiging outcome. And here we are!
            Coming back stronger than ever. Kung para kay Lord, walang
            imposible. Kung para kay Lord, kahit anong mangyari, it will be
            successful. <br /><br />
            I am a servant from The Feast Lancaster— and I can never not be
            proud of that.

          <p>
            <b>Thea:</b> As I reminisce on the events of December 19th, 2023, I
            can't help but remember the call I had with Kuya Ge. I could sense
            his excitement from the moment he invited me to join the call. As
            soon as we connected, he got straight to the point. "G ka ba
            mag-serve sa Feast, Thea?" he asked, referring to the weekly prayer
            gathering of the Light of Jesus family that takes place in our
            community. <br /><br />
            I had been expecting this question, but it still caught me off
            guard. I paused for a moment to gather my thoughts before
            responding. Serving in the Feast was a big commitment, but I knew it
            was an opportunity to give back to my community and connect with
            like-minded individuals. I asked him if he could give me a month to
            decide so I could think about it and be sure of my decision.
            <br /><br />
            On January 28, 2023, I found myself attending an event that I had
            not been to in two years. I was hesitant to go, even though I knew
            what was expected of me and what to do there. It just felt awkward
            to come back after all that time. To ease my nerves, my mom invited
            my boyfriend Christian to come along with me, so I wouldn't feel out
            of place. <br /><br />
            As we arrived, I was surprised to see familiar faces from our
            school, including my friend Trish, whom I have known since the first
            grade. Seeing her made me happy, and I started to think that maybe
            attending the event wasn't so bad after all. <br /><br />
            I expected to see an older preacher, but instead, a new guy named
            Kuya Ge took the stage. He was the perfect speaker for the audience
            filled with kids and teenagers, in other words, the youth. He was
            relatable and inspirational all at once, and I was impressed by his
            ability to engage the audience. Since that day, we have continued to
            attend "big hangouts" every month. It has been a year since I first
            returned, and I can say that I am glad that I did. <br /><br />
            After Kuya Ge saw me and Christian's dedication to attending the
            Feast, he asked if we wanted to serve. This led to a call we had
            that day. A month later, Kuya Ge checked up on me and asked if I
            wanted to serve. I finally responded with a big yes! <br /><br />
            As I walked into the Feast, I couldn't help but feel excited. It was
            the 6th anniversary of the event, and it was my first time attending
            as a servant. I had been looking forward to this day for weeks, and
            now it was finally here. I was going to serve alongside my friends
            and co-servants, Trish and Kirk, as one of the singers in the Feast.
            <br /><br />
            Christian, on the other hand, was in charge of creating the website
            for the event and managing the visual aids. Together, we were going
            to use our talents to serve God and encourage others to do the same.
            Although I wasn't the best singer, I was glad that I could use my
            voice to praise God and inspire others. As the event began, I felt a
            sense of fulfillment wash over me. It was truly a wonderful feeling
            to be able to serve God in this way. Despite being new to serving, I
            felt a sense of belonging and togetherness with my friends and
            co-servants; we were like a family. <br /><br />
            Looking back on that day, I'm grateful that I said yes when I was
            asked to serve. That one decision led me to be around such wonderful
            people for a great purpose. It was an experience that I will always
            cherish in my heart

            <b>Christian:</b> Before joining as a servant, I was a regular attendee at the monthly big hangouts at The Feast Light Lancaster with my girlfriend, Thea. As the sessions went on, Kuya Ge noticed our consistent presence and approached us about serving at The Feast Light Lancaster. He encouraged us to take our time in making a decision, but the moment he asked, I had already made up my mind to join and serve. We soon confirmed our commitment and said yes to serving. <br><br>
            
            I was assigned to the media ministry and tasked with creating the website you are accessing right now. Crafting this website has been a fun and fulfilling experience. It not only allows me to utilize my skills and interests, but also gives me the opportunity to reminisce and relive moments from past sessions. I am dedicated to making this website because it allows me to share the essence of The Feast Light Lancaster with others and encourage them to join our sessions. <br><br>
            
            I have no regrets about my decision to serve. Although there are occasional challenges, they have not hindered my ability to serve wholeheartedly.

            <b>Ate PJ:</b> Several years ago, I was struggling with severe depression that seemed insurmountable. The darkness felt overwhelming, and I lost hope that things could ever get better. I tried so many things/medication/activities that I thought could help me feel a little bit better but it is through prayer and faith, I encountered the profound grace of God. <br><br> 

            His love and mercy reached me in my lowest moments, and gradually, I began to find healing and renewal. Until I found people who understands and were willing to listen and be there for me, guide me and because of their own experiences and testimony I was inspired, I felt a calling to serve and give back, and for the past seven years, I’ve been honored to serve God through singing at my church and to listen and to bring hope to others. This journey has not only brought me immense joy but has also strengthened my faith and commitment to living out God's purpose in my life. <br><br>

            I am incredibly grateful for the transformation I've experienced throughout my 7 years with my co-servants and for the opportunity to contribute to the worship team of The Feast. It is truly a privilege to share the light and hope that I found in Christ with others through music and service.

          <p>
            <b>Trish:</b> There are moments in life when something arrives when you least expect it, and it feels like a light guiding you through the darkness you’re in. For me, that light was the Feast. It happened at a time I needed it most— a period of my life loaded with uncertainties and when I wasn’t at my best, mentally. The Feast wasn’t just an event or a gathering; it became my safe space, my refuge against the constant distress of life. <br><br>

            In those days, when the weight of my problems seemed almost unbearable, The Feast was one of my comforts. It was a place where I could momentarily step away from the issues I was faced with at those moments, may it be my issues with myself or with other things. It was more than just a temporary reprieve—it was a sacred space where I could breathe, reflect, and find solace.<br><br>
            
            However, The Feast Light Lancaster offered something far more profound than mere escape. Rather than allowing me to hide from or run away from my issues, it gently nudged me towards them. It wasn’t about running away from my problems but confronting them with a renewed sense of courage strengthened by my faith. This newfound bravery was not solely of my own making; it was upheld by my faith in God and the supportive community of friends and family that The Feast nurtured. It was as if each gathering was a reminder that I wasn’t alone—God was by my side, and so were my friends and the family I found in the Feast. Their unwavering support was a testament to the power of shared faith and united strength.<br><br>
            
            The sense of family that The Feast offered was something I hadn’t anticipated. Just when I felt as though I had lost so much, I found myself embraced by a new, extended family. The warmth, understanding, and love that I received changed me in a way I hadn't anticipated. It was as if God paved the way to replace my sense of loss and hopelessness with an abundance of new relationships and a stronger relationship with myself. <br><br>
            
            As I reflect on my journey with The Feast Light Lancaster, I am overwhelmed with gratitude. The Feast has been more than a series of meetings or inspirational talks; it has forever impacted my life and it changed the way I viewed my faith. It provided me with community to confide in when I had tough times and it has encouraged me to face my challenges head-on. It has been a source of strength, a reminder of the power of faith, and a testament to the incredible impact of community. <br><br>
            
            Although my journey in life and with my relationship with myself and my faith still isn’t perfect, I am forever grateful for the role that The Feast has played in my life. It has given me more than I could have ever asked for—courage, faith, and a sense of belonging. It has taught me that even in moments of despair, there is always light to be found. For that, I will always cherish and honor The Feast Light Lancaster and the beautiful people who have walked this journey with me.
